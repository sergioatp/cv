  <p>This Contact Us page is for a marketing agency that works directly with businesses.
    <br>Since it knows its audience, Brandaffair encourages visitors to "have a talk" one-on-one rather than providing a one-way communication channel via support resources.
  </p>
  <p>Why this "Contact Us" page stands out:
    <br>Aside from the obvious pink flamingo, Brandaffair captures the visitor's attention with three methods of communication.
    <br>The map provides the exact location of the office, the "Meet Us" section includes a phone number and email for general inquiries, and the "Pitch Us" section includes a template that helps businesses submit their ideas directly to the company
    for consideration.
